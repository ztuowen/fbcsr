# Work in progress

In currently trying to build the code for VBR, as UBSCR seemingly depends on this representation

This might take longer than expected

# File structure

Only a whole bunch of files floating around

* /
    * prefix.h `global definitions and helpers`
    * CSR.c/.h `own representation of CSR`
    * VBR.c/.h `VBR and converters between CSR format`
    * *future* UBCSR.c/.h `UBSCR and converters between CSR format`
